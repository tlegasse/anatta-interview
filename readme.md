# Introduction
This is a coding challenge to demonstrate the ability to complete the following tasks:
- Query the Shopify GraphQL API by product name.
- From the retrieved Shopify products, sort the output in ascending order based on price
- Print the results as sorted

It is recommended to use the [Shopify GraphQL API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql).

this project will be leveraging environment variables collected from a .env file in the root directory. please see the .env.example file in this repository for reference to variables configured therein.
